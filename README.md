# Python-Basics-Mentorship-8-Days
A structured 8-day Python mentorship curriculum designed to guide absolute beginners from foundational syntax to logic-based application development. This project demonstrates curriculum design, technical communication, and the practical implementation of core programming concepts like conditional logic, data collections, and iterative loops.

# TEACHING METHODOLOGY 💡
## SCAFFOLDED LEARNING 
I broke down complex logic into small "byte" sizes, ensuring students were able to understand the  logical flow, before worrying about syntax errors. This ensured that all students were able to efficiently and quickly grasp concepts.
## MOB PROGRAMMING 
Due to the lack of individual computing devices (for some students), I conducted our classes via mob programming. I acted as the "Driver" (typing the code) while the 8 students acted as "Navigators." First, I guided them through solved examples making use of core concepts. After which, they were given "GROUP TASKS" (programming questions) in which they had to verbally dictate the logic and syntax, forcing them to communicate technical concepts clearly rather than just copying text. 
## CONTEXT RELATED QUESTIONS
I gave them problem questions and guided examples that directly linked to real world examples ie, the KSRTC Ticet program, Voting Eligibility program. This made it easier for me to explain concepts more clearly and for them to understand better.

# GOAL 🎯
My goal was to make coding accessible to everyone even if they didn't have their own laptop. Most of my students were actually pretty intimidated by the idea of programming at first, so I wanted to show them that it isn't as scary as it looks. By using local examples they already knew, like KSRTC bus tickets and farming profits, I helped them move past that fear. I wanted to turn them from people who just use apps into creators who actually understand the logic behind them.

# BEFORE 
A survey was conducted prior to starting the mentorship :
* It was discovered that :
* 100% of students had zero coding experience 
* 50% reported they were "very afraid" or "slightly scared" of coding
* 25% reported that they don't have a stable internet connection
* 75% reported wanting to build tools that could benefit themselves and their community but didn't have the skillset to do so.
